# **MakeCOMICS - a project management app for comic creators**

This project is the fifth milestone project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. 
You can see the final deployed site [here.](https://make-comics.herokuapp.com/).

The application is designed to help comic creators collaborate on comics projects and to give feedback and praise at all points of the creative journey.

## UX
### User Stories

I used an agile methodology to devlop the app. The various features were broken up into the following user stories and grouped into epics where applicable. 

As I started working on each user story they were further broken down into tasks. I tracked the progress of the user stories using github projects. You can see the current state of the project [here](https://github.com/John-McPherson/Full-Stack-Tool-Kit-Portfolio-Project/projects/1).
